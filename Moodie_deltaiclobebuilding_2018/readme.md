This file provides documentation to the wrapper used to explore the model developâ€‹ed in "Modeling deltaic lobe-building cycles and avulsions of the Yellow River delta, China" (Moodie et al., in prep). Documentation for specific portions of the model is included as line comments throughout the source code.

# 1.0 Wrapper call syntax
A call to the wrapper looks like this:
```
[s] = virtualdelta_wrapper(preAvulThresh, preAvulTrigg, mouSwitch, QwSwitch, QwNum)
```

- `preAvulThresh` is the "setup threshold", or the amount of channel bed aggradation necessary for avulsion. It is normalized to the bankfull flow depth (i.e., fractional).
- `preAvulTrigg` is the "trigger threshold", ot the amount of overbank flow necessary for avulsion. It is normalized to the bankfull fow depth (i.e., fractional).
- `mouSwitch` is the control for whether, and in what manner, lobe progradation occurs. See section "Input options" below for available options.
- `QwSwitch` is the control for the water discharge curve used in the model run. See section "Input options" below for available options.
- `QwNum` is the input "shape factor" that impacts the selected water discharge curve in the model. See section "Input options" below for available options.
- `s` is the output storage structure which contains a record of the delta evolution.

To run the model with a setup threshold of 60%, a trigger condition requiring 10% of the flow depth to go overbank, enabled lobe progradation, and a repeating cycle of discharge from the Yellow River use:
```
[s] = virtualdelta_wrapper(0.6, 0.1, 'rem', 'mean', NaN)
```

# 2.0 Input options
## preAvulThresh
The amount of aggradation of the channel bed required for avulsion can be any numeric. It should be noted that the value is normalized to the bankfull flow depth, so a `preAvulThresh` of unity implies aggradation of one complete channel depth before avulsion.
