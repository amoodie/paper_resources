<!-- A preprint of the manuscript and supplement is available [from EarthArXiv](nolink). -->

## Processing code
The processing code works by operating four files in the following sequence:
1. MakeDataTable.m
2. MakeStratModels.m
3. ExploreDataTable.m
4. MakeSelectedPlots.m


## Data
The data can be found [on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3457639).
If you use these data, please cite the Zenodo dataset.
